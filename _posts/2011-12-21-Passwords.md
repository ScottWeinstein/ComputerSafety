I use [KeePass](http://keepass.info/index.html) - it's free, popular, and been around for a while. (here are some other [desktop](http://lifehacker.com/5529133/five-best-password-managers) and [web](http://www.passpack.com/en/professional-password-manager/) based managers)

* Install the software and choose a good passphrase (mine is a 5 word phase of about 40 chars)
* Optional - I keep my password database on [Dropbox](http://db.tt/PnMCV7X), so that it's kept in sync between my work laptop and my home PC, but to make this secure, I also use a **key file** in adition to a passphrase. 
The **key file** I copy (just once) via USB thumb drive to the two computers.

Before continuing, make sure you know how to use KeePass, can open it on both machines. 
This is **important**, as if you loose any of the password database, the keyfile, or forget your passphase you are well fucked.

### 2 - Create secure passwords
Bad news, passwords like `f!rstBorn432` are not very secure, and having secure passwords shared across say a music chat site and your bank account is like having unprotected sex in tijuana - a bad idea.
On the other hand, passwords such as `aae34437edf138d7708fef0b7616e4230dc712ff0ff4af6d9ccac377c3cdf3d7` are quite secure - not only are they hard for computers to crack, 
they are impossible for people to guess, and only rain-man types could even think of memorizing it. Don't worry, you'll never have to _type_ this kind of password.

So what you need to do is:

1. Generate (via KeePass) a unique and long passwords for each one of your bank, brokerage, and major on-line retailers' site. 
1. Have a resonable password for your email - something like `f!rstBorn432` is OK for email, provided that you don't use it for anything else **and** you have two factor authentication setup.

note: It's OK to have a common less strong password for entertainment and other unimportant sites.
