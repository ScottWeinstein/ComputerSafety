Backups are the thing that everyone knows they should do, but never get around to it. The good news is that 
it's so easy to setup good backups, there's no excuse not to do it.

I have a **layered** approach, it sounds like a lot of effort, but in practice it's nearly none at all.

###### 
You will need to choose just how safe you want to be, but by all means, you must choose 
**at least 1** of the below options


### 1. Critical (and smallish) files
For day-to-day working data, or critical files (such as a scan of my passport) I keep my files on 
[Dropbox](http://db.tt/PnMCV7X) which seamlessly syncronizes the files between all of my computers. I do this mostly 
so that I have access to my files, whether it's a work or personal computer, and as a nice side benefit, it acts as a backup.
Other options for this approach are [skydrive](https://skydrive.live.com/) and Google Docs


### 2. For [the go bag](http://72hours.org/go_bag.html)
A script copies the contents of my dropbox folder + some additional content onto a 
[fast USB drive](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220253).

### 3. To make sure nothing is lost in case of fire/theft
Dropbox and a USB key aren't sufficient for a full backup (music, video, app installs, etc) so a cloud based backup 
plan is advised. One of:

1. [keepvault](http://www.keepvault.com/)
1. [crashplan](http://www.crashplan.com/)
1. [mozy](http://mozy.com/)
1. [carbonite](http://www.carbonite.com/en/)

### Local image backup 
For those that must be fully secure:

* HP + Windows Home Server
* Synology + Acronis True Image
