I have 3 backup plans, a local image one for when the hard drive dies and I need to get backup within an hour, a cloud based approach in case of theft/fire and I'm glad to get the important suff back in a few days, and a USB drive for [the go bag](http://72hours.org/go_bag.html). 

Approach        Cost        What you can store      Recovery time                   Downside
-------         ---------   ---------------------   ----------------                -------------
Local image     $500-900    Everthing               1 hour + time to go best buy    No fire/theft protection
                                                    to get a new hard drive
Cloud           $60/yr      Everything but video    Hours to days                   First backup can take weeks
USB Drive       $10-$100    Critical files          Instant                         Limted storage
