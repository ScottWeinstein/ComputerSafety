Enable **Two factor authentication** for your primary email - this is critical, as your email is your identify on the web. 
Should you forget a password, the reset link goes to your email account. If a criminal gets your email account, you are _owned_.

If you are not on gmail or hotmail, move your email to one of these two services. **Really**. They are better at spam and intrusion detection then yahoo or whatever rinkydink email program your hosting company is using. 
If you have a custom domain, such as squidnet.com, you can move to gmail for free, hotmail charges a modest fee.
The link for gmail: [two factor authentication](https://accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig?hl=en). 
Gmail provides Printable backup codes - which you can use when traveling, or if you loose your cell phone. I store mine in the notes section of my gmail entry in KeePass.
