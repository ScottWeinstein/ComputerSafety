###### Key message
Your email account is the weakest for online data safety. Your email is your identify on the web. Should you forget a password, the reset link triggers a message your your email account. If a bad actor has access to your email, you are _owned_.

The way to fix this situation is to enable **two factor authentication** for your primary email. What this means is that not only is your password required, but an additional proof that you are you is needed. 

## What to do
1. If you are not on gmail or hotmail, move your email to one of these two services. **Really**. They are better at spam and intrusion detection than yahoo or whatever rinkydink email program your hosting company is using. 
	* If you have a custom domain you can move to gmail for free, hotmail charges a modest fee.
1. The link for gmail: [two factor authentication](https://accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig?hl=en). 
1. Gmail provides printable backup codes - which you can use when traveling, or if you loose your cell phone. I store mine in the notes section of my gmail entry in KeePass.
